## Introduction to Gopher
- ["Getting started with gopher, software, more"](https://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw.lite?a=gopher://gopher.floodgap.com/1/gopher) (*)
- [Gopher article on the Tilde Club's Wiki](https://tilde.club/wiki/gopher.html)

## Gopher Servers
- [Atua](https://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw.lite?a=gopher://forthworks.com:70/1/atua) (*)
- [Flask-Gopher](https://github.com/michael-lazar/flask-gopher):  A Flask (Python framework) extension to support the Gopher protocol. Flask-Gopher is a Flask extension that adds a thin Gopher -> HTTP compatability layer around the built-in webserver. It allows you to build fully RFC 1466 compliant gopher servers, with complete access to Flask's routing, templating engine, debugger, and more!
- [GoFish](https://gofish.sourceforge.net/): seems abandoned since 2012.
- [Gopher2000](https://github.com/muffinista/gopher2000): a ruby-based Gopher server. It is built for speedy, enjoyable development of all sorts of gopher sites.
- [Gophernicus](https://github.com/gophernicus/gophernicus): a modern, full-featured (and hopefully) secure gopher daemon.
- [gosher](https://git.katolaz.net/gosher/): A simple Gopher server in a shell script
- [pygopherd](https://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw.lite?a=gopher://gopher.quux.org/1/devel/gopher/pygopherd) (*): the advanced, multi-protocol Gopher server! PyGopherd is a unique HTTP server as well.
- [spacecookie](https://github.com/sternenseemann/spacecookie): gopher library & server written in Haskell.

## HTTP Proxies
### Instances
